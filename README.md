# Visualizing COVID-19

Visualizing the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).

## New York City (NYC)

The number of COVID-19 cases in NYC started growing exponentially in the last few days. In particular, it more than doubled from yesterday (Mar 17) to today (Mar 18): from 814 to 1871 cases. However, this was fairly expected because there had been so little testing so far. Indeed, this sudden increase is likely due to the fact that there's finally more testing being done. Hopefully, the testing will catch up and it'll provide better data to show us the real COVID-19 situation in NYC.
